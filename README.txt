In this project we used time series to model and forecast the production of distilled alcoholic beverages in France.

The data used are the monthly evolution of the industrial production of distilled alcoholic beverages index from January 1990 to January 2019, on a base 100 in 2015.
These data are available on the INSEE website (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, national statistics bureau of France).

Our results are presented in the report named "Time_series.pdf".
The analysis was performed using R language and the script is available on the file "script.R".
